You can also play againest other players in a local network. One computer runs server.py and another runs client.py in the background while the game is running. Note: The multiplayer functionalities would not work properly if you use one game client, therefore if you want to play with yourself with one computer, you need to pull the game into two seperate folders and launch the game from different folders.
