# Maplestory ITCG #
## Rebuilding the Maplestory's paper-based ITCG card game into a digital version on PC. There is rules menu in the game if you are not familiar with the original paper-based card game. ##
## ##
Run itcg.py to play the game. The game only requires pygame >= 1.9.3 and python >= 3.6. There are totally 4 different background themes/musics at the moment.

You can build your own deck to play againest AI with various difficulties. There are 8 pre-made AI decks with different themes. Don't feel bad if you can't beat the hardest AI difficulty, as the name suggest, it's IMPOSSIBLE.

You can also play againest other players in a local network. One computer runs server.py and another runs client.py in the background while the game is running. Note: The multiplayer functionalities would not work properly if you use one game client, therefore if you want to play with yourself with one computer, you need to pull the game into two seperate folders and launch the game from different folders.
